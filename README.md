This repository contains the carabiner attestation collector and various
parsers for envelopes, statment types (well only in-toto is upported ATM!)
and predicates.

The two main consumers of this repository are 
[ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¢ AMPEL](https://github.com/carabiner-dev/ampel)
and [ðŸ¥¨ bnd](https://github.com/carabiner-dev/bnd) but any project that
needs to download, read and sotr attestations can benefit from this module.

This project handles attestations using an abstractionabove the vanilla intoto
attestations by relying on the
